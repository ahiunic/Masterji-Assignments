## Overview
The **Mood Tracker** is a simple web application that allows users to log their daily mood using emojis, store the logs in `localStorage`, and visualize past moods through different views (day, week, month) along with a calendar representation.

- **Local Storage:** Moods are saved in the browser's `localStorage` for persistence.
- **Mood History:** A list displays past moods with filtering options (Day, Week, Month).
